## ðŸ›  Design Decisions

- **Architecture**: MVVM with Repository pattern for clean separation of concerns.
- **Room DB**: Used to store tasks locally for offline access.
- **Firebase Analytics**: Logs task events like `task_added`, `task_completed`, `task_edited`.
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Tracks app crashes and simulated DB crashes.
- **Mock API Integration**: Added sync functionality using Retrofit to simulate real-world REST API usage.
- **UI**: Built using XML layouts with Material Design components and FAB for task addition.
